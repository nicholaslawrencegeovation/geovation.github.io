The Hub: London’s digital district data lab. For all you creative people who want to experiment with property and location information and technology.

If your idea needs property or location information to make it work, you’ve come to the right place. Geovation is all about experimenting and developing your ideas. Location is everywhere, and our mission is to expand its use in the UK’s innovation community.

This blog is a space where our team of software engineers can share code, educate us with the location-based projects they work on and for all things tech related. 

Visit geovation.uk/programme to find out more about our funded accelerator programme for property and location-based startups.
